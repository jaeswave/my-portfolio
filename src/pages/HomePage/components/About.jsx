              I{"'"}m a versatile tech professional with core expertise in full
              stack software development, project management, and cybersecurity.
              As a Full Stack Engineer, I build responsive, secure, and
              high-performing applications using technologies like React,
              Node.js, Next.js, NestJS, and Docker. As a Project Manager, I
              drive product delivery through agile processes, effective team
              coordination, and strategic planningâ€”ensuring quality and
              consistency across the board. As a Cybersecurity Specialist, I
              focus on building resilient systems with strong authentication,
              data protection, and vulnerability prevention measures integrated
              by design. I'm passionate about creating tech solutions that solve
              real problems, leading with a balance of technical precision and
              big-picture thinking.
